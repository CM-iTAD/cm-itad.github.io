        "Phase-change materials store and release heat as they melt and solidify, flattening the temperature swing across a façade. Whether they actually do this depends on control: if the material never fully charges or never discharges, it is inert mass.",

West is chosen as an adversarial orientation — intense low-angle sun in the late afternoon, coincident with peak outdoor temperature and peak utility demand. Eighteen runs (six cases × three climates) completed in EnergyPlus 25.2, with future weather generated by two independent methods that agree within 0.3–0.5 °C.",
        "Two results drive the work. Solar control dominates: fixed louvres cut annual cooling 23–35% and a deployable exterior blind roughly 51%, and those savings largely survive to 2080. PCM placement, tested systematically across four locations, turns out to be decisive in a way capacity is not — the identical material cuts cooling about 2% in the opaque spandrel, 3–4% in the glazing cavity, but 47% when placed in the transmitted-beam path on the floor.",
        "The failure mode matters as much as the saving. Riyadh summer nights now sit at 30–33 °C, warmer than the cooled zone, so passive night ventilation and overnight PCM regeneration cannot run — and the floor placement's benefit erodes from −47% to −31% by 2080 for exactly that reason. Daylight analysis exposes a second tension: external louvres give the best usable daylight but barely control view glare, while blinds and adaptive fins control glare by over-blocking daylight. No single passive device does both.",
